# Homework 1

This homework practices the material from:

* Functions and Implication
* Products and Conjunction
* Coproducts and Disjunction
* Unit and Empty Types, Truth and Falsehood

Replace every `sorry` with a term or proof of the required type. Follow any
proof-style instruction given above an exercise.

Some exercises come in pairs that state the same result twice. Prove the first
of the pair with a direct term and the second in tactic mode.

When an exercise is in tactic mode, build the proof with tactics. Passing
`exact` a single term that does the whole job (a `fun`, a `Sum.elim` or
`Or.elim`, a nested `⟨...⟩`) skips the practice the exercise is for.
